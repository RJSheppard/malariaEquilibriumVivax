#' @description Often we are interested in the state of a given malaria
#'   transmission model at equilibrium. However, some models (e.g. the Griffin et
#'   al. 2014 model, the White et al. 2018 model) are quite complex, and can result in equilibrium solutions
#'   that are fairly in-depth. In these situations it is useful to have a
#'   "canonical" equilibrium solution that is tried and tested, and can be used
#'   reliably by multiple users. This package complement the malariaEquilibrium 
#'   package to store canonical equilibrium solutions for Plasmodium vivax malaria models.
