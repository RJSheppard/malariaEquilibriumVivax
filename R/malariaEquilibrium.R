#' @title malariaEquilibrium
#'
#' @description Often we are interested in the state of a given malaria
#'   transmission model at equibrium. However, some models (e.g. the Griffin et
#'   al. 2014 model) are quite complex, and can result in equilibrium solutions
#'   that are fairly in-depth. In these situations it is useful to have a
#'   "canonical" equilibrium solution that is tried and tested, and can be used
#'   reliably by multiple users. This package aims to be a place for hosting
#'   these canonical solutions, and for storing useful tests, checks and
#'   plotting functions for exploring a given solution.
