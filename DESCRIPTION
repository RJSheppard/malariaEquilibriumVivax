Description: Often we are interested in the state of a given malaria
   transmission model at equilibrium. However, some models (e.g. the Griffin et
   al. 2014 model, the White et al. 2018 model) are quite complex, and can result in equilibrium solutions
   that are fairly in-depth. In these situations it is useful to have a
   "canonical" equilibrium solution that is tried and tested, and can be used
   reliably by multiple users. This package complement the malariaEquilibriumVivax 
   package to store canonical equilibrium solutions for Plasmodium vivax malaria models.
