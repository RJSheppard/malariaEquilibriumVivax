Description: Often we are interested in the state of a given malaria transmission
        model at equibrium. However, some models (e.g. the Griffin et al. 2014 model)
        are quite complex, and can result in equilibrium solutions that are fairly
        in-depth. In these situations it is useful to have a "canonical" equilibrium
        solution that is tried and tested, and can be used reliably by multiple users.
        This package aims to be a place for hosting these canonical solutions, and
        for storing useful tests, checks and plotting functions for exploring a given
        solution.
